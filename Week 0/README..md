\# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program \- VSD    
\*\*Participant: India Cohort\*\*  

Welcome to my journey through the \*\*SoC Tapeout Program by VLSI System Design (VSD)\*\*\!    
This repository tracks my \*\*week-by-week progress\*\* with tasks, learnings, and project updates.  

\---

\#\# 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools  

\#\#\# 📌 Task 0: Tools Installation    
\- Installed \*\*Icarus Verilog (iverilog)\*\* for RTL simulation.    
\- Installed \*\*Yosys\*\* for synthesis.    
\- Installed \*\*GTKWave\*\* for waveform visualization.    
\- Verified installations successfully. ✅  

\#\#\# 📌 Task 1: Create GitHub Repo & Document Video Summary    
\- Created this \*\*GitHub repository\*\* to record my learning journey.    
\- Documented the summary of the \*\*introductory program video\*\*:    
  \- The program teaches how to design a \*\*System-on-Chip (SoC)\*\* using open-source EDA tools.    
  \- Covers complete flow: \*\*RTL → Synthesis → Floorplanning → Placement → Routing → GDSII\*\*.    
  \- Aims to empower engineers in \*\*India’s semiconductor ecosystem\*\* through hands-on silicon tapeout.    
  \- Provides real tapeout experience with support from \*\*VSD, Efabless, RISC-V International, ISM, VSI\*\*.

\#\# 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0    
\- Understood the \*\*importance of open-source tools\*\* in VLSI design.    
\- Learned basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.    
\- Explored the \*\*SoC design flow\*\* at a high level.
